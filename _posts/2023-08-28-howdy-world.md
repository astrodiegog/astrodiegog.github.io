Howdy World !

This be my website. Currently, it aint much, but I'm hoping that I can build it to something that allows me to capture my path through graduate school and beyond.

I want to provide descriptions on research projects that I'm either interested in or working on under the [Research](/research) tab. Under [Resources](/resources), I want to share resources that I've collected along the way. I don't expect them to be 100% correct and up-to-date, but I aim to be accurate to my experiences and try to fix anything as I find issues. Here in the ~[Blog](/posts)~ section, I want to provide mini-updates. It is _very_ barebones at the moment, but I'm optimistic that if I put enough work to start a website, I'll end up maintaining it as well... right?

So how do you make a website?

Well I was initially inspired to make a website after coming across this article on [AstroBetter](https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2021/05/04/creating-a-website-to-promote-your-scientific-work/) which goes over the main basics that you need to learn about creating a website. In short, the three main questions to answer are:

- what tools are you going to use to build the HTML/CSS that ends up rendering the website
- where are you _hosting_ the website - where are all the files going to live
- what service are you using to get your domain name

Because I like to make things difficult to myself, I used a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) theme that served as a template, specifically [academic](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic). If this is something your interested in, also take a look at the [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template language. Because I'm not too crazy, I decided to host this using Github Pages. This [article](https://paulle.ca/jekyll-tutorials/deploy-jekyll-site-github-pages) was very helpful in getting the website up and running. I'm not a web developer, but this is what has worked for me !

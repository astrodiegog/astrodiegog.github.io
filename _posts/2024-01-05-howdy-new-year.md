title: "Howdy New Year"
---

It's 2024 ! First official quarter of graduate school is finally done with. I took three courses: Introduction to Astronomical Research and Teaching, Introduction to Astronomy 2, and Observational Astronomy. I feel very happy with my outcomes and enjoyed my time taking the classes. I felt extremely supported by the instructors, my first-year cohort, and the general astronomy community at Santa Cruz. Coworking hours (2-hour Tuesday and Thursday working sessions) were extremely valuable to talk about ideas and work through problems with others.

I created cheat sheets under the [resources](/resources) tab for each class. Broadly, I learned and became more familiar with

- Astro Research and Teaching
  - Universal Design Learning
  - Growth Mindset
  - Metacognition
- Intro to Astro 2
  - Viewing physics as fields
  - Physics is conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
  - Tidal gravity
- Observational Astro
  - Light path to detector
  - How to observe & best practices
  - Data reduction
  - Writing observation section of papers and technical section of proposals

I have gained the most impact from applying the concepts of growth mindset and metacognition onto my academic, research, and personal life. I feel much more comfortable analyzing _how_ I am learning and how to _improve_ my learning experience. Combined with thinking that learning new things are possible with the correct support, I feel much more prepared and less anxious about graduate school than how I felt early September 2023.

I feel like this past quarter has been a lot of just getting accustomed to life in Santa Cruz as a graudate student, and preparing myself for the future. I have been developing tools and setting practices that I hope to continue over the next couple years so I can develop cool skills. For example, I wasn't crazy familiar with LaTeX coding and I developed a fear that I'm going to be forgetting lots of the stuff that I just learned from classes this quarter. So to help my future self that may need to understand something (say the definition and application of enthalpy), I created a cheat sheet for my classes with Overleaf. I want to be kind to my future self and set myself up for success. I think that documenting in an organized manner where I am essentially talking to myself will help.

For 2024, I want to continue these practices (including making quarterly-ishh posts here). I want to keep working to better myself and give myself the best chances at success, and this perspective (which I have practiced couple times at UChicago) was more formalized as "growth mindset". Outside of academics, I have been developing an [API for Cholla](https://github.com/astrodiegog/cholla_api) that is going to help me when analyzing simulations. I also want to be kind to my body and take some physical education classes. I'm taking tennis next quarter with two other first years and I'm super excited for that ! I want to make the time to take as many PE classes as possible. My thought process is that if I start collecting knowledge on different exercises (tennis, scuba diving, soccer, basketball, weight lifting, volleyball, martial arts) and actually practice them, then I can only improve my physical health (with a healthy diet). It's like collecting infinity stones, or upgrading my character (both physical and knowledge) in a video game. I have the time and resources available to do this, so I want to continue doing this in 2024.

I would like to be consistently reviewing and asking myself a couple things (copied from an [advising form](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/academics/graduates/new_prospective/Files/Grad_Student_Advising_Form_Rev_Oct13.pdf) that isn't used)

1. Describe current research progress. Discuss any updates and/or changes to any previously submitted timelines.
2. Anticipated funding sources for next three quarters and note any uncertainties.
3. Milestones for next quarter (and beyond). Examples are: FLASH, Prelim Exam, draft paper, journal submission, Board Review, Qualifying Exam, Thesis update, Thesis Defense. Give approximate dates, if known.
4. What are my current priorities? Am I satisfied with my time management? Do I need further help in setting priorities and managing your time?
5. Feedback on adequacy of physical environment, as in office space, computers, furniture, general work environment.
6. What is my participation in science discussion opportunities within the department?
7. Feedback on any classes.

Here's to an exciting, consistent 2024 !

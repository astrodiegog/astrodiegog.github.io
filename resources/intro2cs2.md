title: "Introduction to Computer Science 2"

Here I share the notes I took while taking [Introduction to Computer Science 2](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2021/spring/15200-1/) (not actual site used, but very similar). This class was taught by 2 professors: Hannah Morgan and Anne Rogers. I had Anne Rogers this time around.

This class was about learning imperative programming with the C programming language. This class taught about program design, data abstraction, pointers, managing memory, and data structures.

This class was taught remotely and synchronously, but luckily the professors were nice enough to record the lectures as well, so that was pretty cool. I share the notes taken from these synchronous lectures, but no code from any assignments.

Apart from the lectures, we had short exercises, timed assessments, and programming assignments. The timed assessments basically turned to a midterm and final. The short exercises were pretty easy small puzzles that you had to solve. The programing assignments, like with Computer Science with Applications, was the most fun part because of the cool things we had to build of the class's subjects using C:

1. Betting Game
2. Image Processor
3. Task Manager
4. Digital Word Tree
5. Multi-core simulator

Again it was really cool to do it and also time intensive. The class lectures covered the following subjects:

1. [C basics](/resources/intro2cs2/Module1_C_basics.pdf)
2. [Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation](/resources/intro2cs2/Module2_Pointers_and_Dynamic_Memory_Allocation.pdf)
3. [Linked Lists](/resources/intro2cs2/Module3_Linked_Lists.pdf)
4. [Trees](/resources/intro2cs2/Module4_Trees.pdf)
5. [Graphs](/resources/intro2cs2/Module5_Graphs.pdf)

One of the more fun classes I've taken!

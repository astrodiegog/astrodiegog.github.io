title: "Fluid Dynamics"
---

Here are I share my resources for Intro to Astro 2 (ASTR 204) taught by Professor Ruth-Murray Clay. The course covered lots of fundamentals of fluid dynamics and some gravitation topics. There were lots of applications covered in class from hydrostatic equilibrium to accretion disks.

The two main textbooks that cover these topics are: 

- _Principles of Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics_ by C. J. Clarke and R. F. Carswell
- _The Physics of Astrophysics Volume II: Gas Dynamics_ by Frank H. Shu

To review the topics and have a document I can reference in the future, I created this [cheat sheet](/resources/fluids/ASTR_204_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

Helpful links throughout the class:

- [Physical Constants and Astronomical Data](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~george/constants.html)
- [Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates)
- [Vector calculus identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus_identities)

title: "Observational Astronomy"

Here are I share my resources for Observational Astronomy (ASTR 257) taught by Professor Andrew Skemer. The course included a week-long field trip to Lick Observatory the week before the fall quarter began. Andy covered lots of observational astronomy topics that I was exposed to throughout my time at UChicago with much more motivation. We got exposure to photometry, spectroscopy, and adaptive optics.

From this course, I became much more comfortable with using instruments, reducing raw data, and writing professional observation sections.

As a computational astrophysicist, I am familiar with, but don't know lots of these topics off the top of my head. In effect, I created his handy-dandy [cheat sheet](/resources/obsv_astro/ASTR_257_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) that I can reference in the future.

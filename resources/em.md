title: "Electricity and Magnetism"
---

Here I share the resources from Electricity and Magnetism courses (PHYS 225 & 227) taught by Professors Young-Kee Kim (E&M1) and David Miller (E&M2).

Both classes were taught in a regular lecture style with weekly homeworks and exams. E&M1 gave us two midterms and a final. E&M2 was only 1 midterm and a final. I didn't do too well in E&M 1 mainly because of the tests. It was more of a gradual learning experience because the concepts aren't too intellectually challenging, it's quite straight-forward and intuitive, but wrapping your mind that this picture is happening in real life is hard to picture. E&M 1 was a lot of giving you an equation and using it in an example 1 or 2 times to get it. E&M 2 was much more conceptually challenging with practice problems few and far between.

E&M 1 was just some basic static electricity and magnetism, and E&M 2 was simply adding time dependence to everything.

E&M 1 covered the following topics:

1. Basic Linear Algebra
2. Multivariable Calculus Review
3. Gauss's Law
4. Electric Potential
5. Work & Energy
6. Conductors and Capacitors
7. Laplace's Equation
8. Uniqueness Theorem
9. Electric Displacement and Polarization
10. Biot-Savart Law
11. Ampere's Law
12. Dipoles & Multipole Expansion
13. Magnetization
14. Torque on Dipole

The primary textbook used for this course was [Griffiths E&M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Electrodynamics). We covered about up to Chapter 6. Here are those lectures:

E&M was having Maxwell's Equations and the Electromagnetic Wave Equation evolving under certain conditions over time and analyzing fields, potentials, energies, or momentum. E&M 2 was probably one of the most intellectually challenging and enlightening courses I've taken. Going from using discrete functions and particles to potentials and fields was hard to imagine but it's how things actually work.

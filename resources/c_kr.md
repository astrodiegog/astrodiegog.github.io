Here I share notes I took while reading through the OG C Programming language [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) by K&R.

I was going to take a computer science class where I would have to code in C, so I just took the couple weeks before the class to start learning C.

These notes cover basic things like some syntax, bitwise and arithmetic operations, loops, functions, pointers, and structures.

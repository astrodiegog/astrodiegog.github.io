I am a NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University of California at Santa Cruz pursuing a PhD in [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/index.html). I am interested in studying the astrophysical processes in the formation and evolution of the Universe's first galaxies using theory and computation.

I earned my BA in Physics and BS in Astrophysics at the University of Chicago in June 2023.
